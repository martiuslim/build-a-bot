# Build-a-Bot Workshop Series
> An Hour-of-Code initiative for the Singapore Management University Microsoft Student Community by SMU Microsoft Student Partners.  

## About
This workshop series serves as an introduction to `chatbots`, building one using `Microsoft Bot Framework`, `Node.js`, `git` and deploying it online via `Microsoft Azure` to `Telegram`.  

Content by Martius Lim, inspired by Alyssa (see the original Bot Framework Tutorial by her [here](https://github.com/alyssaong1/Bot-Framework-Tutorial))

## Getting Started
